1. Copy the gitsetup directory to your machine (the path to this directory must
   not contain any whitespaces!).

2. Create an account on the github website: https://github.com/

3. Install git on your machine. Open a terminal, go to the gitsetup directory
   and execute
       sudo apt-get install git-core git-gui git-doc

4. Set up git on your machine.
   1. Go to the gitsetup directory and execute
          ./setup1 USERNAME "NAME" EMAIL LOCAL_ROOT_DIR
      USERNAME is the your github username (byill)
      NAME is your name (e.g. "Bob Yill")
      LOCAL_ROOT_DIR is a full path to the (new) directory where you want the
      code to be placed. This path must not contain any whitespaces!
      (e.g., ~/work/my_stuff/summerProject)
      Example:
          ./setup1 jlewis "Jack Lewis" jack.lewis@gmail.com ~/my_stuff/summerProject
   2. Leave passphrase empty (less secure, but will save a lot of time)

5. Setup your ssh key on the github website
   1. Go to your gitsetup directory, open file copyme.txt and copy its content
   2. On the github website go to Account Settings/SSH Keys, click on Add SSH
   key and paste the previously copied text into the Key textbox

6. Wait to be added to the group (uoft-tsa)

7. Go to the gitsetup directory and execute
       ./setup2

8. Add LOCAL_ROOT_DIR/summer2012/gitsetup to your PATH.
